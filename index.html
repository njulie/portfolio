        				<h3>Studying abroad made me start asking people, "what's your story?"</h3>
        				<br>
        				<h2>storie su strade italiane</h2>
        				<p>(stories on Italian streets)</p>
        				<p>On the second day that I arrived in Florence, I was told to venture out into the city, strike up conversation with Italian strangers, and ask them about their stories. Um...what? Here I was at orientation, having just been informed to avoid eye contact and smiling at strangers in the street for safety and cultural purposes, now being freed onto the cobblestoned streets of Italy unsure how to even begin a conversation, nevertheless in Italian. Talk about awkward. Mildly terrified, I and two other students exited out of Palazzo Capponi in frazzled panic. Several uncertain minutes later, we stumble upon a display of beautifully adorned wedding cakes resting on the ledge by Ponte Vecchio ("Old Bridge") connecting where we stood to the heart of Florence. A few feet away, behind the lens of a black DSLR, was a woman, and by her side, a man.</p>

        					<img src="assets/images/cake.jpg" width="280" height="280" alt="Sorry the image didn't load, plz reload the page or just imagine some elaborately decorated cakes!">
        					<figcaption>The cakes. (couple not shown)
        					</figcaption>
        				</figure>
        				
        				<p>I was with two other students and we went <em>Wait what are they doing...they look like they have a story, who takes pictures of cake on a bridge?? You say hi, no <strong>you</strong> say hi...you're the one who took Italian last quarter (ok mind you I took Italian for 10 weeks prior and could manage a "hi, how are you, bye" type of conversation, not some deep, profound, tell me your life story chit chat).</em> So I said, "Ciao, siamo studenti da Stanford..." And...that was it for my Italian. Awkwardness and pauses ensued, though lucky for us, not for long - she invited us to use English. So I asked the most unspecific and broad question of all, "what's your story?" not knowing what response we would get, or what story she would interpret that to mean, but what we received was an actual movie-like love story of how he was born in Turkey and she in Korea, how they met at school in Italy, her to make leather handbags and him to be a chef. Of how his being a chef inspired her to bake cakes instead of making handbags and that the reason why there were adorned cakes laid out was to display on the website of her new baking business.</p>
        				
        				<p>At that moment, I realized how unique each person's story is. Faces in a crowd, passengers on a train, people walking in the streets, and it only takes one simple question to pull down the stranger barrier. <mark>The ability to empathize, feeling what people feel and thinking what they think, is a skill I became more in tune with to understand people and their behaviors, a skill I now integrate into my efforts as a designer.</mark> Here, in a foreign country, I became comfortable being uncomfortable, unafraid to do bold, new things, and hungry for more exhilarating experiences.</p>
