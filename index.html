        				<h3>How studying abroad made me start asking people, "what's your story?"</h3>
        				<br>
        				<h2>storie su strade italiane</h2>
        				<p>(stories on Italian streets)</p>
        				<p>On the second day that I arrived in Florence, I was told to venture out into the city, strike up conversation with Italian strangers, and learn about their stories. I'm sorry, what?! I literally just get here in a foreign country with barely any Italian skills under my belt, was informed the day before that people typically don't make eye contact with or smile at people on the streets in Italy (as part of their culture), and now I'm supposed to approach strangers and ask them for their story in a country whose language I know little about? Mildly terrified, I and two other students exited out of Palazzo Capponi in uncertain panic. Minutes later, we stumble upon a display of beautifully adorned wedding cakes resting on the ledge by the Ponte Vecchio ("Old Bridge") crossing the Arno River. A few feet away behind the lens of a black DSLR was a woman, and by her side, a man.</p>
        				<figure>
        				</figure>
        				<p>"Ciao, siamo studenti da Stanford..." I then stumbled to figure how to ask "what's your story" in Italian. "It's ok, I can speak English," the woman consoles. As it was my first conversation with a stranger in Italy, I expected hesitancy and awkwardness and I was right. But what I didn't anticipate was how that hesitancy easily melted into a storytelling journey. Of how he was born in Turkey and she was born in Korea and how they met at school in Italy. Of how she came to Italy to make leather handbags and how he came to Italy to be a chef. Of how his being a chef inspired her to begin baking cakes instead, and how now she is photographing wedding cakes on the famous bridge in Italy to upload on her website for her new cake baking business. Of how she's moving to Turkey with him for their wedding. Oh also how she and the other student with me could exchange conversations in fluent Korean. That was pretty cool.</p>
        				<p>But it wasn't the story that really amazed me (don't get me wrong, I think the story's incredible). It was seeing how people's lives could be so connected across distance, however cheesy that may sound. <mark>At that moment, I discovered how incredible it was to hear people's stories and imagine living in their shoes and being inside their heads, and that ability to empathize, feeling what people feel and thinking what they think, is what I apply into understanding people and their behaviors by learning about their experiences.</mark></p>

I learn fast and am the type of person who will resposition a mirror on the wall 36 times with a millimeter difference each time until it is precisely horizontally straight.
