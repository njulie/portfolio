  					<p><strong>Goal:</strong> In two days, design a wine bottle label for Stanford's house Casa Italiana's Pizzeria event.</p>

                    <section>
      					<h3>Where To Start?</h3>
      					<p>I knew I wanted "La Casa Italiana" (the name of the house) on the label to represent the host of the event, so I started experimenting with different ways to portray the text. Without images...with images...uppercase...lowercase, here is just a small pool of my ideas.</p>

                        <h3>Where To Go?</h3>
                        <p>I wanted the label to be simple, minimal, and elegant, focusing mainly on the house name and Pizzeria event. Found some cool images on the web and tried them out to see how the label would look with an image background. After working with the house staff, we agreed to include four elements of Italian culture: coffee, music, wine, and pizza, reflected in the second rough mock below.</p>

                                <p>After many revisions, the staff and I agreed that the background image was too much chaos to the eye, so we swapped the background for a simple outer border to add a bit of fancy.</p>
                                <p>We also thought the all-capitals lacked personality but represented elegance quite nicely, so we opted for a harmonious mix of fancy script plus simple capitals. To the right we have one revised iteration of our final product.</p>

                                <p>Something looked off about the music note, and no matter which note icon I replaced it with, nothing looked right. Instead, I substituted music with olives, and the logo immediately looked more balanced. Something also had to be done about the awkward space under "La". Playing around with a vineyard feel, I added some vines and curls to make the L fancier and more characteristic. Check it out!</p>
