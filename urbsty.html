					<h1>Design Process: <span>Urban Styles Website</span></h1>

					<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Give Urban Styles contemporary dance group an online presence for publicity, general information, and contact.</p>

					<h3><span>Stage 0: </span>Channel Outside Inspiration</h3>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-6">

						</div>
						<div id="moodboard-info" class="col-md-6">
							<p>Urban Styles is a contemporary dance group that possesses characteristics of a refined company as well as the sassy jazz side of funk and fun. I wanted my moodboard to capture fun, boldness, and elegance. Inspiration came from geometric shapes, primary colors, and minimalistic, simple designs.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h3><span>Stage 1: </span>You've Got 2 Minutes! Sketch! Go!</h3>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-5">
							<img src="projects/urbsty/sketch1.jpg" alt="My sketches are currently hiding...try refreshing to help the server locate them!"/>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-7">
							<img src="projects/urbsty/sketch2.jpg" alt="My sketches are currently hiding...try refreshing to help the server locate them!"/>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h3><span>Stage 2: </span>Rough It Out With Some Wireframes</h3>
					<p>From my preliminary sketches, I selected a few ideas that were unique to expand upon. How unique and out there can I get with this?</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-6">
							<img src="projects/urbsty/wf1a.jpg" alt="Wireframe 1 is currently hiding...try refreshing to help the server locate it!"/>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							<img src="projects/urbsty/wf1b.jpg" alt="Wireframe 2 is currently hiding...try refreshing to help the server locate it!"/>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-6">
							<img src="projects/urbsty/wf1c.jpg" alt="Wireframe 3 is currently hiding...try refreshing to help the server locate it!"/>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h3><span>Stage 3: </span>Mockups</h3>
					<p>From my wireframes, I chose some to refine to flush out every detail and see what the finished product would look like on a web server. Made within Affinity Designer.</p> 
					<img src="projects/port-mock1.png"/ alt="Mockup 1 is currently hiding...try refreshing to help the server locate it!">
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-6">
							<img src="projects/port-mock2.png" alt="Mockup 2 is currently hiding...try refreshing to help the server locate it!"/>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h3><span>Stage 4: </span>Implementation</h3>
					<p>Following the mockup with the yellow brushstroke, it was now time to implement the design. I used Masonry's JavaScript library to achieve the grid effect, added padding to the white project labels to create a sense of airiness and space, and enlarged the font-size of the body copy to allow for better readability. As a last touch, I swapped the yellow brushstroke for a deep purple, richer paint pattern. The variation in hues, shades, and multitude of strokes and streaks more accurately represent the many layers of creativity I possess. Through several more rounds of iteration and revision, I reached the design that you are seeing now.</p>

					<h3>Final Product</h3>
