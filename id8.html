  					<p id="task">Three students and I designed the interface for a mobile app (under a general theme of self-discovery) that would allow people to strengthen their creative skills, as part of CS147, Stanford's Intro to Human-Computer Interaction course.

                        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                        <p>We aimed to aid the process of self-discovery through strengthening creative intuition. It will offer users the opportunity to document spontaneous ideas, exercises to help spark inspiration, and an effortless way to think about ordinary things in a new perspective.</p>

                        <h3>What's the Problem?</h3>
                        <p>Creativity is the foundation for problem-solving. But there exists the notion that creativity is an innate skill that one is either born with or without. In many team brainstorming scenarios and project meetings, idea generation often comes to a stagnant halt, whether it's due to exhausted ideas, unfocused minds, fixed attention spans, or something other. This is natural. Running into blocks is inevitable. The real problem is when we can't figure out how to get past those blocks and get unstuck in our ideas. With Id8, we are building creative confidence and revolutionizing the way we think. Generate wild ideas, defer judgement, and think out of the box.</p>

                        <h3>Brainstorming and User Research</h3>
                        <p>To begin, we interviewed a logistical college debate coach, a professional dancer, and a member of Design For America to gather observations on how people viewed creativity.</p>
