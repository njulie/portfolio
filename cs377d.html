			<h1>Redesign the Commute Experience</h1>

					<p id="task">In 3 weeks, redesign the commute experience for medium-distance commuters assuming autonomous cars are the common method of transportation. This was part of CS377D: Designing Calm under the d.school, Stanford's Institute of Design.</p>

					<section>
						<h3>Collecting Data</h3>
						<p>Two other Stanford students and I set out to tackle this broad design challenge by scoping for information and interviewing commuters. To see what challenges commuters in general faced and amass as much user data as possible, we sent out a survey and publicized it on social media platforms.</p>
						<p>In it, we asked participants to imagine a world without commuting, leaving the involvement of autonomous cars a secret to avoid biasing their answers. Then, we inquired what activities they would want to do if given more time in the morning to see what mattered to people in the time between waking up and driving to work. We also asked participants to provide a description of their commute experiences, both positive and negative, to clue us in on which experiences to enhance and which ones to rectify.
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Research Findings</h3>
						<p>Over 200 commuters participated in our survey over the course of 1 week, and based on their responses, we categorized the top three stressors or challenges commuters faced when driving. 51% of participants mentioned negativity towards bad drivers, 43% expressed stress about running late for work, and 39% mentioned struggles with traffic.</p>

						<br><br>
						<p>Our second insight was that given extra time in the morning, 75% of commuters would sleep in, with other response such as "watch the news," "eat breakfast," or "exercise."</p>

						<br><br>
						<p>Our final step in conducting preliminary research was to interview real commuters about their transportation experience. It was time to get our hands dirty in the actual field, the field of the people we were trying to design for.</p>

						<h3>Reframing the Question</h3>
						<p>All of these findings spoke to one main topic, that the stress comes mainly from distractions on the road. Combining this insight with the fact that many people expressed interest in sleeping, we reframed our design task as such:</p>
						<h2 style="line-height: 1.75em; color: #473C8B">"How might we remove commuters from environmental stressors on the road that makes them feel relaxed on their way to work?"</h2>
						<p>Now that we had a narrow angle to proceed, it was time to prototype an experience.</p>

						<h3>Prototype 1: The Infinity Room</h3>
						<p>With prototype 1, we aimed to isolate the passenger from the outside environment and transport them into a different space. To achieve this, we chose to cover up the windows.</p>
						<p>For Test A, we covered the windows with scenic nature images to aid mental relocation to another place, invited passersby to step into the car, played them two soundtracks (30 seconds highway traffic, 30 seconds tropical rainforest noise), and asked them to imagine driving from one place to another.</p>
						<p>For Test B, we covered the windows with reflective material to create the sense of space (building off the idea of the infinity room) and repeated the process for Test A.</p>

						<br><br>
						<p>Our biggest finding from this round of user testing was that covering the windows made users feel trapped and claustrophobic, which brings us to prototype 2.</p>
					</section>

						<h3>Prototype 2: The DozePod</h3>
						<p>Focusing less on visual manipulation and more on the relaxing experience, we carried out two more trials.</p>
						<p>In the first, we drove users around in the passenger seat for 5 minutes, with no instruction, allowing the Spire, a breathing rate tracker, to collect the user's initial breathing rate.</p>
						<p>In the second, we covered their eyes with a blindfold, inserted earbuds connected to calming ocean sounds, and reclined their seat, where the Spire continued to record their respiratory rate.</p>
