					<p>CityTix is a passion project*. The mobile app is designed for a performing arts theater to aid in ticket sales.</p>

					<p>I conducted field observations, created customer personas, and built multiple prototypes and tested them with people to better realize my vision.</p>

					<h2 class="cursive pb-2">Understand the Customer</h2>
					<p>The first step in my process is to conduct field observations and discover where customer pain points are. These findings then lead to a set of customer personas to help drive design direction through the prototyping process.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6 align-self-center py-4">
						<h3 class="cursive">Field Observations</h3>
						<p>Since New York City Center (NYCC) is one of Manhattan's performing arts theaters, I started my research there. I talked on the phone with customers, helped them buy tickets over the phone, and interviewed NYCC staff members. </p>
						<p>Many customers were on-the-go while buying tickets over the phone (e.g. in a cab, walking around their apartment, out in NYC), which often introduced loud background noises and other distractions. <strong>This key insight later factored into my decision to create a mobile app, since mobile apps are ideal for on-the-go experiences.</strong></p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6 align-self-center py-4">
						<h3 class="cursive">Customer Personas</h3>
						<p><strong>Through my phone calls and interviews, two personas emerged.</strong></p>
						<p>Most callers were people like Julia. They belonged to the elderly population and were most likely loyal customers who attend a show once a month. They may be less adept with using technology, which means the app design should stay away from new trends and stick with ones late mobile adopters are already familiar with.</p>
						<p>The rest of the callers were people like Juan. They were likely in their 20s and 30s, potential students, more price-sensitive, and less frequent show-attenders.</p>
						<p><strong>The personas indicated that the design should guide "Julias" through the app ("Juans" would need less guidance) and provide enough information for the "Juans" to learn about the shows ("Julias" would likely be familiar with the shows already).

					<div class="col-lg-6 align-self-center py-4">
						<h3 class="cursive">Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
						<p><strong>The existing customer experience was painful for several reasons.</strong></p>
						<p>Tessitura, the software sales reps were using to handle ticket sales, was difficult to use and prone to errors, which forced customers to repeat themselves over the phone and made it harder to follow through with a sale.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6 align-self-center py-4">
						<h3 class="cursive">Heuristic Evaluation (cont.)</h3>
						<p>Customers almost always specified ticket details in this order:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Show name</li>
							<li>Date</li>
							<li>Time</li>
							<li>Seating</li>
						</ol>
						<p>But Tessitura's calendar view did not follow the customer's mental model, which made the experience difficult. There was no way to search tickets by show name.</p>
						<p><strong>In the mobile app solution later, I would make sure the customer could search tickets by show name first.</strong></p>

				<h2 class="pb-3 cursive">Hypothesize, Create, Test</h2>

				<p>After research, I typically jump straight into creating low-fidelity screens to get ideas out on paper, run it by a few people to validate macro-level workflow architecture, and then revise and add in more detail.</p>
				<p>I intentionally restrain from adding too much interaction or detail in the first few versions so the customer feels more comfortable providing negative feedback, seeing a rough first draft.</p>

				<div class="py-5 row">
					<div class="col-lg-4 align-self-center">
						<h3 class="pb-3 cursive">Wireframes Version 1</h3>
						<p>I mocked up a low-fidelity prototype in Figma and conducted a usability test with three people (two in their 50s and one 30 year old).</p>
						<p>I asked them to use the prototype to purchase tickets for the show "NDT" on a specific day and time. All three people were amateur show-attendees.</p>
						<p>I categorized the feedback in pink in the image <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HQBnK_2dP6IxqNcjy_SPJmmcLNOHcZ5sXwHuhFdf9SA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">(as well as with other colors in the raw notes)</a>. <strong>The biggest takeaway was to help orient customers while finding seats (use a seating map).</strong></p>

				<div class="py-5 row">
					<div class="col-lg-4 align-self-center">
						<h3 class="pb-3 cursive">Wireframes Version 2</h3>
						<p>Based on the feedback, I created a second medium-fidelity prototype in Framer with the following revisions:</p>
						<ol style="font-weight:400;">
							<li>Added a first time user experience</li>
							<li>Added a search experience; removed show genre on first page because not many customers cared about/used the genre</li>
							<li>Add interactive seat map</li>
							<li>Refined the scan credit card experience</li>
							<li>Added in some motion/animations to simulate real app behavior</li>
						</ol>

						<p>After a second round of user testing with the same two people in their 50s and a woman in her mid-twenties, I <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dgsIa2vsArR_P-rPLh6JNSB6p7kxSbisY-NU3vznFfE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">received and categorized the following feedback into actionable design changes</a></p>
						<p>For delight and final visual polish, I also added a splash screen and illustrations into the first time experience.</p>

				<h2 class="pb-3 cursive">Next Steps</h2>

				<p>If I were to continue this project, my next steps would be to work on perfecting more elements of the visual design as well as the animations. I'd also like to test this prototype with a wider range of people in New York. Within the design, I'd like to do more research on how users complete the payment part of the experience and evaluate how to make the "scan credit card" option more prominent (make it the default option), as this would greatly improve the ticketing experience. There are also some details within the select seat experience that I would like to perfect and improve upon.</p>
				<p>Overall, this was a fun project for me to explore design concepts and exercise mobile prototyping skills for an idea within the performing arts industry! Thanks for making it through.</p>
