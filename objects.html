					<p>Objects is an enterprise web app that makes it easy to store, serve, backup, and archive data for developer applications. I worked on a cross-global team (US and Bangalore), consisting of two product managers and 10+ engineers.</p>
					<p>I was the sole designer on this product, partnering with product managers to use market and customer research to inform design decisions, creating all design assets (user story documentation, UX vision presentations, wireframes and mockups) and working with engineers during implementation.</p>

						<h3 class="cursive">The Problem</h3>

						<p>To put data into perspective, I first researched infographics to understand real world use cases for storing big data. Make the intangible more tangible. With the growth in data, <a href="https://media2.govtech.com/images/940*639/Understanding-How-Big-Data-Flows-in-Healthcare-thumb.jpg" target="_blank">hospitals need object storage (source)</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/quantumcorp/status/631164158294257664" target="_blank">so does law enforcement (source).</a></p>
						<p>Then, I read up on the technical documentation for how object storage differed from other storage architectures (file and block) and ultimately learned that object storage is the only architecture that is equipped to handle data at scale (I could go further into detail into what it is about the architecture that makes it this way, but this would become much more technical than it has to be!).</p>
						<p><strong>Based on early customer interviews, we discovered that IT teams don't really know how much data they need to store or how fast they wanted the service to run, which we later used as an opportunity to add textual guidance within the product when admins would set up the service to help them out.</strong></p>

					<div class="col-lg-8 py-4 align-self-center">
						<h3 class="cursive">User Personas and Stories</h3>

						<p>Following early customer interviews, I established <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BvcjCSCMMEbZhdHN5iPsXZzYnEPL6L7T/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">three key user personas and seven workflow scenarios (see sample of presentation)</a> to ensure we were designing the product with IT admins in mind.</p>
						<p>I presented these key workflows to the team so that everyone was thinking from the perspective of the customer (this helped focus on designing first for experience rather than building in more features). In addition, I created and shared a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MoEMD6PHm4i24PV95NIhlm-j-Dt2HnWL/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">doc to track the full list of user stories (see doc)</a> our MVP would support.</p>

						<h3 class="cursive">Competitive Analysis / Inspiration</h3>
						<p>Finally, I looked within the competitive landscape to identify how we could distinguish our product from all the other object storage solutions out there.</p>
						<p><a href="Projects/objects/aws3-UI.png" target="_blank">Amazon s3's object storage solution is powerful and robust</a> but also complex and overwhelming for a novice IT admin. Despite the complexity, it is the most prevalent tool used today, and the fact that admins are already familiar with the workflows is something to acknowledge and consider in our designs.</p>
						<p><a href="Projects/objects/spaces-UI.png" target="_blank">Digital Ocean's object storage solution is lighter and less intimidating for novice users.</a> It brings a lighter feel into what is traditionally heavy and complex. I looked to them early on for inspiration because they challenged the status quo by adopting a metaphor that both connected beautifully to their brand and conveyed a new mental model of how to understand storage architecture.</p>

			<!--<p>As the sole designer, I wanted the team to take a similar approach, present technical terms in simpler to understand concepts, but I ran into my first challenge; influencing a team of industry experts resistant to change and insistant on following what is considered "standard" in the enterprise field. After several discussions and meetings around terminology, I decided to make an early sacrifice within design to gain rapport with the team so that later down the line I'd have a greater chance of receiving buy-in for design-led decisions.</p>
						<p>As I researched the complexities of the object storage experience, I asked more and more questions. How will IT admins understand this complex topic through our product? How will admins learn to use the tool? How can we create an experience where they don't need to read lengthy documentation to understand the product?</p>-->

						<h3 class="cursive">Final Designs</h3>
						<p>An IT admin needs to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WFwudhWDLtwtuVCorZHhiptLTkRTrRsE/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">install the service, create object stores and add people to the object store (PDF)</a> so that developers can start using the service.</p>

						<p>Devs need to create buckets to store data and do other actions on it (e.g. share buckets with other developers like sharing access to Google Docs, "lock" buckets so no files can be altered for legal purposes).</p>

							<h3 class="pb-2 cursive">Sometimes...explorations are dead ends</h3>
							<h4 class="text-secondary cursive">Sample Visuals</h4>
							<p>Early in the design process, I explored some ways to help admins get an overview of what types of objects/files are stored in their environment. We assumed that seeing a distribution of data by their size and where (what clusters) the data resided on would help admins better understand their storage environment and troubleshoot issues.</p>
							<p>These explorations were scrapped after conducting a user test with five different admins. I discovered that while they understood what the visualizations were trying to convey, they expressed that they didn't know what to do with the information. In their day-to-day use of the product, they wouldn't find any value in seeing the visuals. While the engineers on the team were enthusiastic towards the visuals due to the "wow" factor, I decided it was better to keep the user interface filled with elements and actions admins would actually need on their day-to-day jobs rather than wow them once and leave them with irrelevant visuals on every day after.</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-lg-6 pb-2">
								<h4 class="pb-2 cursive text-secondary">Feedback</h4>
								<p>After the early access release to around our initial customers, the team received feedback about how simple the object store experience was, compared to the typical complexity of storage infrastucture products.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-lg-6 pb-2">
								<h4 class="pb-2 cursive text-secondary">Next Steps</h4>
								<p>Future improvements would include exploring more graphs that would be categorized by users so that admins could contact their developers when capacity was running low. Being able to see who was using how much storage would help with their internal reports.</p>
