  					<p id="task">I volunteered to design a flyer in 4 days for TriDelta Sorority's House of Pancakes, a fundraising event to benefit St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.
                        <br><br>
                        Guidelines:
                        <br>| Blue and gold color scheme
                        <br>| Mention Tridelta and St. Jude's
                        <br>| Date, time, location of event
                        <br>| Unlimited pancakes!
                        <br>| Ticket prices
                    </p>

                        <h3>Organizing Information</h3>
                        <p>The challenge here was to find a way to include all the information needed without the flyer seeming too crowded or overloaded. Stanford students needed to know it was an event sponsored by TriDelt and that it was for a philanthropic cause. They also needed to know quickly and immediately where and when the event would be held. Ticket prices were secondary.</p>

                        <h3>Two Heads Are Better Than One</h3>
                        <p>I gave my sketches to another sorority member to whip up a quick, rough mockup. She decided to combine the first design (top left in JPG 1) with the fifth design (top right in JPG 2) because she liked them both.

                            <div class="col-sm-3"></div>
                            <div class="col-sm-6">

                    <section>
                        <h3>Three Variations on a Theme</h3>
                        <p>What I liked in the mockup was the phrasing and organization of the header/title information. Taking this design into a second round of iterations, I changed the typography, added some features, and shifted the triangles around to add emphasis to the date and time of the event. I also couldn't decide which font and color combination worked best, so I left it up the TriDelta staff to decide between these three.</p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-sm-4">
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="projects/dhop/1.jpg" alt="flyer 1">
                                    <figcaption>Variation 1</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-sm-4">
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="projects/dhop/2.jpg" alt="flyer 2">
                                    <figcaption>Variation 2</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-sm-4">
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="projects/dhop/3.jpg" alt="flyer 3">
                                    <figcaption>Variation 3</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Of the three variations, I decided to select variation 1. Version 3 fonts gave off too much of an old diner vibe, with the serifs of "DHOP". Version 2 was better, but the script font was a bit too much fancy, and our event (classy as we are), didn't possess the elegance that the cursive font embodied. Variation 1 was the perfect mix of fun, modern, and simple. And there we go!
